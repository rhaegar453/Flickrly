## Application Working

The home page is where you'll be prompted to enter into the groups route. 
Once in the groups route, if you start typing, you'll get the recommendations different groups with similar name. 

> Note: Clicking on a group in the recommendation will not open the gallery page to that group. Rather, you'll get the results as the group cards with that name along with some of the photos in each of the groups.  

> If you press enter while typing, results pertaining to that query in the form of group cards will appear along with some group
photos. 

On clicking a particular group, you'll be taken to that group photos page where you can see the different photos in that group. 

I've implemented the rest of the things as mentioned in the document.
